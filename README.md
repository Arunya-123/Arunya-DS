DATA SCIENCE NOTES

**An Introduction to Machine Learning **


Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI).  The goal of machine learning generally is to understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and utilized by people. Although machine learning is a field within computer science, it differs from traditional computational approaches. In traditional computing, algorithms are sets of explicitly programmed instructions used by computers to calculate or problem solve. Machine learning algorithms instead allow for computers to train on data inputs and use statistical analysis in order to output values that fall within a specific range. Because of this, machine learning facilitates computers in building models from sample data in order to automate decision-making processes based on data inputs. 

Eg:- Facial recognition technology allows social media platforms to help users tag and share photos of friends, Self-driving cars. 

 **Machine Learning Methods **

Two of the most widely adopted machine learning methods are  

    supervised learning which trains algorithms based on example input and output data that is labeled by humans. 

    unsupervised learning which provides the algorithm with no labeled data in order to allow it to find structure within its input data.

Supervised Learning: **

In supervised learning, the computer is provided with example inputs that are labeled with their desired outputs. The purpose of this method is for the algorithm to be able to “learn” by comparing its actual output with the “taught” outputs to find errors, and modify the model accordingly. Supervised learning therefore uses patterns to predict label values on additional unlabeled data. A common use case of supervised learning is to use historical data to predict statistically likely future events. It may use historical stock market information to anticipate upcoming fluctuations, or be employed to filter out spam emails. In supervised learning, tagged photos of dogs can be used as input data to classify untagged photos of dogs. 

For example, with supervised learning, an algorithm may be fed data with images of sharks labeled as fish and images of oceans labeled as water. By being trained on this data, the supervised learning algorithm should be able to later identify unlabeled shark images as fish and unlabeled ocean images as water. 

 **Unsupervised Learning **

In unsupervised learning, data is unlabeled, so the learning algorithm is left to find commonalities among its input data. As unlabeled data are more abundant than labeled data, machine learning methods that facilitate unsupervised learning are particularly valuable. Unsupervised learning is commonly used for transactional data. You may have a large dataset of customers and their purchases, but as a human you will likely not be able to make sense of what similar attributes can be drawn from customer profiles and their types of purchases. With this data fed into an unsupervised learning algorithm, it may be determined that women of a certain age range who buy unscented soaps are likely to be pregnant, and therefore a marketing campaign related to pregnancy and baby products can be targeted to this audience in order to increase their number of purchases. 

 
**Approaches **

First define correlation and regression, as they are commonly used techniques for investigating the relationship among quantitative variables. 

Correlation is a measure of association between two variables that are not designated as either dependent or independent.  

Regression  is used to examine the relationship between one dependent and one independent variable.
